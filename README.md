# HTML & JavaScript Beginners’ Playground

Welcome to the **HTML & JavaScript Beginners’ Playground** repository! This project is designed to help new learners get comfortable with basic web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each participant will have their own dedicated folder to experiment, practice, and learn at their own pace.

## Overview

This repository provides a safe environment where beginners can:

- **Learn HTML Basics:** Understand the structure and tags that make up a webpage.
- **Experiment With CSS:** Add styling to your pages and gain confidence in working with colors, fonts, and layouts.
- **Practice JavaScript:** Get familiar with basic scripts, event handling, and simple DOM manipulations.

Every learner will have their own folder (e.g., `your-name/`) where they can freely create and modify files without affecting others.
